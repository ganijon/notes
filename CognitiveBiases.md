# Cognitive biases: thinking traps
Why do we value a $10 note that we find down the street more than a banknote in our wallet? Why do we prefer to hire a candidate who is similar to us, even though we might miss out on a rare talent? Quite simply because our reasoning is disturebed by cognitive bias in daily life. 

To break free of these mechanisms, we need to understand them. If you recognise yourself in these examples, then this article is for you.

## Interference in our professional relations

Let's recognise common cognitive biases that can adversely affect recuitement and team work.

### Representativity bias
We often make judgements based on stereotypes or information of psychological type, rather than statistics. In fact, wide range of personalities can be found in any profession. And, candidate selection must be based on whether the candidate has all required skills.

### Familiarity bias
We tend to prefer people who belong to our social group or share our outlook on the world. We place more trust in people who are close to us. Recruiters may tend to choose the candidate who is similar to them, as a result, they may miss out on talent.  

Familiarity bias could explain the persistence of discrimination. This is the reality in the employment market, but the puzzle for economists, who see a diversity as a factor for creativity and dynamism.

### False concensus
When we have doubts about our own judgement, and it differs from the other participants', we, then, tend to follow groups opinion. 

Another case, when individuals in daily contact with people who share their values, tend to overestimate the number of individuals with similar opinion.

## Investments that are often irrational

Let's identify cognitive biases that might disrupt the principle of economic rationality when an investment is made

### Aversion to Losses
This cognitive bias of **aversion to losses** can be seen in decision-making where there is a certain level of risk.
This is how human nature is: we are more sensitive to the perspectives of losses than gains. This can explain the success of savings accounts, despite very low interest rates.
> aversion: a strong dislike or disinclination; something that arouses strong feelings of dislike;

### Status quo bias
A CEO is hesitant to sell shares to his company, even though this could bring significant value. This CEO is fallen vistim of **status quo bias**. Leaving things as they are could mean missing out on a profit, but it does away with the need to make a decision that could prove to be a bad one.

## Brakes on creative thought
Let's try to detect conginitive biases limiting our creativity and preventing us from finding innovative solutions.

### Availability bias
When asked to make arbitrary free choices, we tend to opt for what comes to mind and satisfies us spontaneously. Often at work, we don't take advantage of freedom of choice we are given to opt for other ideas.

### Anchoring bias
Anchoring bias prevents us from looking for another solution. We fail to appreciate the repercussions of new events, to imagine other results and other choices. A striking example, in a company the next year's budget is based on the last year's budget.

### Confirmation bias
Confirmation bias can lead us to missing opportunities. The danger is we let others to make innovations. We all tend to give value to opinions and facts confirming our own views and hypotheses, and, to ignore anything that contradicts them. As a famous example, Harry Potter manuscript was turned down by at least ten publishers.

Many mistakes are made due to prejudice. Let's imagine a publisher who is convinced that fantasy literature and magic are of no interest to the public. They will have a negative prejudice about Harry Potter before they even read it.
